### Hi there ðŸ‘‹


## Hi and welcome!
   
I am **[Susi Zajitschek](https://www.ljmu.ac.uk/about-us/staff-profiles/faculty-of-science/school-of-biological-and-environmental-sciences/susanne-zajitschek)**, 
a  Lecturer in Animal Behaviour at Liverpool John Moores University. 

I have only recently discovered my passion for GitHub. While I have been using R for several years to analyse my data, discovering R markdown and other fancy stuff has been very revealing in the past few months!

So now I use this platform on the one hand to make my research transparent, organised and accessible (but have some patience, this is a work in progress), but on the other hand (and perhaps predominantly at this stage) to develop teaching material.

Covid-19 has forced us to get creative with a very sudden transition to online teaching - and I have learned a lot!
So watch this space, there will be many more exciting tools and resources to share appearing in the near future ... :smiley: 

I am currently learning about shinyApps, and have used this to create web-based interactive course design (such as https://metaanalysis.zajitschek.net/). 

... and just if you are wondering how I managed to adjust my GitHub profile - the secret is revealed [here](https://css-tricks.com/the-github-profile-trick/)!!
