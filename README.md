### Hi there ðŸ‘‹


## Hi and welcome!
   
I am **[Susi Zajitschek](https://www.ljmu.ac.uk/about-us/staff-profiles/faculty-of-science/school-of-biological-and-environmental-sciences/susanne-zajitschek)**, 
a  Lecturer in Animal Behaviour at Liverpool John Moores University. 

I have only recently discovered my passion for GitHub, particlularly in the context of research and for teaching! 

But watch this space, there will be many more exciting tools and resources to share appearing in the near future ... :smiley:

I am currently learning about shinyApps, and have used this to create web-based interactive course design (such as https://metaanalysis.zajitschek.net/). 

... and just if you are wondering how I managed to adjust my GitHub profile - the secret is revealed [here](https://css-tricks.com/the-github-profile-trick/)!!
